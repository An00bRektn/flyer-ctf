# OMEGALUL

Analyst! Someone got onto Jorge's server and left this image as the wallpaper. It just seemed to be some vandalism, which we managed to fix. But, we are unable to locate the perpetrator. Can you find where this *hooligan* came from?

## Solution
There were a few ways to do this but they were all the same pretty much
1. Use `strings`
2. Use `exiftool` to read the exif data, where I put the flag
3. Use [Jeffrey's Image Metadata Viewer](http://exif.regex.info/exif.cgi) to view the exif data
