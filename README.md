This repository contains challenge files and source code used in the local/private Flyer CTF ran from April 7-9. Some challenges used in the CTF were taken from other CTFs (I put this whole event together with minimal outside help give me a break), and those have been placed in password protected archives and acknowledged to respect the creators of those challenges.

## A note about the malware section
> Note stolen from [PMAT Labs](https://github.com/HuskyHacks/PMAT-labs)

This repository contains live malware samples for use in the Flyer CTF that ran from April 7, 2022 to April 9, 2022. These samples are written to emulate common malware characteristics. Although they are not "in the wild" samples, they are, and should considered to be dangerous. These samples are to be handled with extreme caution at all times.

- Do not download these samples to a computer you do not own.
- Do not execute any of these samples on a computer you do not own.
- Do not download and/or execute these samples in an environment that you cannot revert to a saved state, i.e. a virtual machine.
- Practice safe malware handling procedures at all times when using these samples.
