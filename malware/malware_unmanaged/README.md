# Unmanaged

Analyst! It seems one of the project managers downloaded fake software called "Project Unmanagement", and we're now seeing many anomalies in activity across our network. We're currently handling the brunt of the attack (modified registry keys, ya know the deal), but we could use your help to reverse this sample and understand the full extent of the intrusion.

## Solution
After running `strings` on the binary, you should identify a LARGE block of base64 encoded text. After decoding it, you should find some obfuscated PowerShell. Deobfuscate the PowerShell however you choose, and identify the flag in the second stage.

This is the only malware challenge I will provide source code for. It's based on the [execute_powershell_bin.nim](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/OffensiveNim/blob/master/src/execute_powershell_bin.nim) proof of concept from the OffensiveNim repository, which uses the winnim library to host the Common Language Runtime to run arbitrary PowerShell without directly calling `powershell.exe`. `powershell.exe` gets called on later out of sheer laziness, but yeah.
