# easy phish
Analyst, it appears we've been hit by a phishing campaign. Apparently, some prankster in the IT department dropped this PowerPoint on his friends, and then people started doing it to each other, and we need to go run *another* phishing awareness meeting. While we're doing that, could you take a look at the sample and check for IOCs and tell us if you find anything?

## Solution
This was a remake of Upgraded from the HTB University 2021 Quals. Use the oletools toolkit to extract the VBA macros from the PowerPoint, and then recreate the decoding algorithm in a language of your choice to find the flag.
